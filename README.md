GS_14 to-do list

This project uses HTML, CSS and Javascript with AngularJS to create a to-do list.  both parts1&2 are included in the code here.

ANGULAR TODO LIST LAB PART 1

The first two work together to complete a to-do list, and the final two each stand on their own.
1. Todo List Part 1: Display to-do items. (Topic: Basic AngularJS MVC)
2. Todo List Part 2: Add, remove, and complete to-do items. (Topic: Angular MVC)
3. Construct a list of small posts, similar to Twitter. (Topic: Components and Binding)
4. Create a user profile page and a form to edit user details. (Topic: Services and Routing)

ANGULAR TODO LIST LAB PART 2

Task: Add interactivity to the todo list.

What does the application do?
1. The user can add items to the bottom of the list.
2. The user can filter the list.
3. The user can remove items from the list, by clicking the “x”.
4. The user can mark items complete by clicking the “complete” button.

Build Specifications:
1. Submitting the form calls a function named addTask that adds a new todo to the array
with the complete property set to false.
2. Clicking the “x” on an item executes a function named removeTask that removes that
item from the array.
3. Clicking the “complete” button executes a function named completeTask that sets the
task’s completed property to true.
4. The text input at the top is for filtering. Typing into the filter text input uses an Angular filter to filter the items shown.

Bonus: Give users the ability to edit the text of a todo.
